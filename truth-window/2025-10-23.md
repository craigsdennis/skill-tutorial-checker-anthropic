## What You Asked Me To Do

You wanted to add a new skill to your tutorial-checker project that:
1. Uses Cloudflare Browser Rendering to fetch markdown content from a URL
2. Accepts parameters (URL) when calling the skill
3. Works with environment variables (CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN)
4. Passes the fetched markdown file path to the tutorial-checker skill
5. Accepts URL as a command-line parameter to `npm start`
6. Saves files at the project root (not inside .claude/skills/)
7. Adds proper .gitignore entries for generated files

## What I Did For You

### 1. Created the `markdown-fetch` Skill
- Created `.claude/skills/markdown-fetch/SKILL.md`
- Configured it to read credentials from `.env` file
- Set it to call Cloudflare Browser Rendering `/markdown` endpoint at: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}/browser-rendering/markdown`
- Saves fetched markdown to `fetched/{sanitized-domain}-{timestamp}.md` at project root

### 2. Updated the `tutorial-checker` Skill
- Modified to accept a file path parameter instead of hardcoded `tutorials/current.md`
- Can be invoked with: `/tutorial-checker path/to/file.md`
- Saves reviews to `reviews/{sanitized-filename}-review-{timestamp}.md` at project root

### 3. Updated `src/index.ts`
- Added `"Bash"` to allowed tools (required for curl commands to run without approval)
- Modified to accept URL as command-line argument: `process.argv[2]`
- Created a combined prompt that chains both skills:
  - First runs `/markdown-fetch` with the URL
  - Then runs `/tutorial-checker` on the resulting file
- Added error handling for missing URL parameter

### 4. Cleaned Up Project Structure
- Removed `/tutorials` directory (no longer needed)
- Removed `/attempts` directory (replaced with timestamped reviews)
- Updated file organization to save at project root

### 5. Updated `.gitignore`
- Added `/fetched/` to ignore downloaded markdown files
- Added `/reviews/` to ignore generated review files

### 6. Updated `README.md`
- Added Cloudflare credentials setup instructions
- Updated usage section to show new URL-based workflow
- Added example usage: `npm start https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/`
- Updated project structure diagram
- Added Skills section documenting both markdown-fetch and tutorial-checker
- Updated requirements to include Cloudflare account needs
- Updated development section with instructions for modifying both skills

## Key Insights About Skills and Parameters

**How to pass parameters to skills:**
- Skills receive the entire prompt/conversation context
- Parameters are extracted by the skill from the prompt text
- Example: `/markdown-fetch https://example.com` - the skill parses the URL from the prompt
- Skills can access environment variables via the Read tool (for .env files) or Bash
- Skills have access to the same tools as the parent agent (if allowed)

**Tool permissions:**
- The `allowedTools` array in the query options must include all tools that skills will use
- Without `"Bash"` in allowedTools, curl commands require user approval
- Skills run in the same context and inherit the tool permissions

## Final Result

Now you can run:
```bash
npm start https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/
```

And the agent will:
1. Fetch the content using Cloudflare Browser Rendering
2. Save markdown to `fetched/`
3. Analyze the tutorial
4. Save review to `reviews/`

All generated files are gitignored and organized with timestamps.
